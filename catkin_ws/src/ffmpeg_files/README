1) Move ffserver.conf to /etc as sudo

2) Run ffserver_start.sh

3) Go to this URL to view video stream

P.S The default ffserver config settings are in...you guessed it...ffserver_default.conf. Yay!...I guess~

This URL has lots of info

For auto run

In order to run ffmpeg service without typing command 

/usr/sbin/webcam.sh

Go to /etc/rc.local -> then add command line /usr/sbin/webcam.sh before "exit 0"

Useful trick, could be used to launch roscore as well
