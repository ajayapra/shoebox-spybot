- **06/12/17**: Installed UBUNTU MATE + ROS on the Raspberry. Reinstalled UBUNTU GNOME 16.04 and ROS on the laptop. Configured VNC. Made this repository. Created base workspace. Created remote sourcing bash script (may need work as ROS_IP is being set blank). Tested remote sourcing bash script; works. Cloned and synced workspaces in both machines.
